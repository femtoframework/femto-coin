# femto-coin
A tiny JSR330 standard Inversion Of Control container.  COIN stands for "New Inversion Of Control".  Actually, it started since 2005, there was no IOC standard at that time. Now in micro service, serverless and kubernetes' world, it still useful for server side service development. That's the reason I make it open source.
